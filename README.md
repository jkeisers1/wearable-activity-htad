-write a short summary of why we are interested in these features extracted from the raw data


-what did the function: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_audio, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
) do

-what does the function:
audio_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
    ("clf", RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))
])
do

-eplain confusion matrix
-what are all the features ?
